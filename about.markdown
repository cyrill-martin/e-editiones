In the [NIE-INE]-project we develop an infrastructure to enable scholarly edition projects in the Humanities to express their data in an enriched format, adhering to the FAIR-principles, and ensuring long-term storage of the data.

The project runs at the Swiss Universities of Basel, Bern, ZÃ¼rich, and Geneva until end of 2020.
