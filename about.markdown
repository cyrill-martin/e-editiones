The [NIE-INE](http://www.nie-ine.ch)-project developed an infrastructure to enable scholarly edition projects in the Humanities to express their data in an enriched format, adhering to the FAIR-principles, and ensuring long-term storage of the data.

The project ran at the Swiss Universities of Basel, Bern, ZÃ¼rich, and Geneva until the end of 2020.
