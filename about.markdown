This website contains the knowledge and products as outcome of the [NIE-INE](http://www.nie-ine.ch)-project, which runs at the Swiss Universities of Basel, Bern, and ZÃ¼rich, from Oct. 2016 until the end of 2020, funded by [swissuniversities](https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/?r=1).
 
It developes the infrastructure [inseri]() (to come) to enable scholarly edition projects in the Humanities to express their data in an enriched format, adhering to the FAIR-principles. It provides the projects with the necessary apps and visualizations, and ensures long-term storage of the data, partially by transferring those to another framework, the Data and Service Center for humanities (DaSCH)<!---(https://dasch.swiss/)--->.

The essence of the infrastructure is that data, e.g. in XML or SQL, are converted to a different i.e. machine-interpretable format by using the W3C's [Semantic Web technology (SWT)](/semantic-web-technology-introduction) standards and by making the semantics of the data explicit. This entails a series of [advantages](/semantic-web-technology-advantages), of which semantic interoperability is the most prominent one.  

To enable domain data expression in this new format, a series of formal dictionaries or [domain ontologies](/ontology) are [modeled](/ontology-modeling) with great care, based on those standards.  

Having semantic interoperability is only the beginning of the journey and part of the return on investment (ROI).
The crux of SWT, and the other part of the ROI, is using the ontologies and the formal data expressed by them in [N3-rule-based machine reasoning](/n3-rule-based-machine-reasoning) to infer new data from existing data, bringing ultimately new domain knowledge.  

We adopted a [two-step formalization](/two-step-formalization) methodology to implement the SWT end-to-end.  

Of course this novel way of modeling and processing data is also applicable to science outside Humanities, and other domains.

The development part of the NIE-INE project is in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/nie-ine).
There are also the repositories unrelated to SWT.  

After 2020 the website will be maintained and the ontologies on GitHub will be developed further.
