There are two series of ontologies: more general and project ontologies.

The [generic ontologies](#generic-ontologies) comprise the core concepts for scholarly editions, as well as the bulk of entities modeled in agreement with the edition projects.

The [project ontologies](#project-ontologies) contain entities linked to the specific subjects of edition projects, but they are still usable outside the respective projects.
